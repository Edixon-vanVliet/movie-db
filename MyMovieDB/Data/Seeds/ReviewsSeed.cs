            new Review(136, 36, "Michael", "The plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually, but what I like about Men With Brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about Canadians."),

            new Review(139, 39, "Michael", "Most consumers of lo mein and General Tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it, so, hopefully, this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons."),
