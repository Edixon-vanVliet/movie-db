# My Movie DB

Let's say we have a client with a new project in mind. He is an expert in the world of films. For years, the client has been storing the movies and their reviews on a book note, but now, hundreds of films later, he has decided to implement a digital platform. He would like to have a platform to store all the movies along with the reviews and ratings. Apart from this, the platform should provide a good set of filters to get the list of entries.

## Requirements

You have to implement an API to provide the following features:

- Create a movie.
- Add a review to a specific movie.
- Get a movie (to see its details).
- Get the list of reviews of a movie.
- Disable a movie (Disable, don't delete)
- Get a list of movies:
  - Should br able to filter the list of entries.
  - Should br able to sort the list of entries.
  - Should br able to paginate the list of entries.

The client has not specified the name and method to use on each endpoint. He said you are the expert and should decide a proper name, structure, and method for each route.
